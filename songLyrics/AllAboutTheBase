yeah, it's pretty clear. I ain't no size 2.

But I can shake it shake it like I'm supposed to do.
I got that boom-boom that all the boys chase.
I got all the right junk in all the right places.

Because you know I'm all about the base, about the base, about the base...

My mama she told me don't worry about your sizes. 
Boys like a little more booty to hold at night

Working that photoshop
We know that shit shit real
Common now make it stop.
If you've got beauty beauty, just raise them up.
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top.

Booty Booty blah blah
